      <p>There was a knocking at the door. I brushed Lucy’s clinging hands away, and went to open it.</p>
      <p>It was Mrs. Gilmore, a lady we knew from church. She stood uneasily there in the doorway in a blue dress, her plump hands clutching a handful of marigolds. She patted my head, saying she was sorry and asking for my father.</p>
      <p>I thought of him, holed up in his room, angry and refusing to talk to anybody or to even come out for dinner. No, he was in no business to see visitors, no matter how well-meaning.</p>

      <p>Her round face beamed at me, assuring me that it was all right. She’d be glad if I just took the flowers in where they could brighten up the house a bit. She hoped it would help.</p>
      <p>Marigolds were Mama’s favorite.</p>
