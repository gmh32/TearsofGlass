      <p>In the silence, I can hear the water pouring from the skies, the water pouring from my eyes, and the water pouring from the antique that made such beautiful sounds. It echoed and crashed up the walls and into the dining room, where Mama entertained her guests. It flowed upstairs, where she sat rocking Rosamundeâ€™s cradle with me, and to my room, where she put me to sleep with stories of dolls and fairies.</p>
      <p>As the notes poured forth, it all came back in a flood.</p>
